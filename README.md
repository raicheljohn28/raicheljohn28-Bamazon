# Bamazon

Created an Amazon-like storefront using MySQL, the MySQL NPM Package, and the Prompt Package.

The application will take in orders from customers and deplete from the store's total supplies.

Initializing node bamazon.js in the command line brings up the storefront. It will ask you what you'd like to purchase by item number and how many.

If there are enough then it will adjust the quantities and continue.

If there are not enough, an error message will occur.

This link below has the video of how the Bamazon works.
